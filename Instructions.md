## About

## Project Structure

To get the project properly configured, put the train and test directories from the [Kaggle emotion detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthu017/emotion-detection-fer/code) in the data folder. Run preprocess.ipynb to load the data and augmented versions of it into data.npz and data_aug.npz respectively.

Run preprocess.ipynb first to get the correctly formatted data. Then either baselines.ipynb or project.ipynb can be run.
